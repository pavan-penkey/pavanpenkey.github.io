# About Me

I am a Lead Protection and Control Engineer at GE Vernova – Grid Solutions with over ten years of experience designing, developing, and commissioning LV, MV, and HV protection systems for utilities, hyperscale data centers, offshore wind, and renewable energy projects. 

My work focuses on mission-critical power systems, utility transmission substations, and inverter-based resource (IBR) integration**, with the goal of enabling a resilient, secure, and future-ready electric grid. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Idaho to bridge the gap between industrial application and academic research.

## Why My Work Matters

The electric grid is undergoing a rapid transformation driven by renewable integration, digital infrastructure growth, and inverter-dominated systems. My work sits at the intersection of engineering rigor and real-world deployment, ensuring protection systems remain dependable and secure as the grid evolves. By validating complex logic through HIL simulations and conducting detailed root-cause analysis, I help ensure that the infrastructure powering our digital future is both resilient and reliable.
